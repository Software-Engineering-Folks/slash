- Coupon Scraping: Incorporate coupon scraping functionality to help users save even more by automatically finding and applying available discounts.
- Expanded Scraper Coverage: Add more scrapers to cover a wider range of e-commerce websites, offering users more options and better deals across various platforms.
- Enhance the application by integrating an AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI's GPT models or other AI services. This chatbot will interact with users to understand their product preferences based on feature descriptions and suggest relevant products sorted by relevancy.
- UI Improvements? [Edit Please]


:thought_balloon: Use Case
---
* ***Students***: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time to search for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites.Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.
* ***Data Analysts***: Finding data for any project is one of the most tedious job for a data analyst, and the datasets found might not be the most recent one. Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually important.
