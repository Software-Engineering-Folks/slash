# :muscle: What's Next for future development?

- **General Enhancements**
  - **Caching Scraped Results**: Running the scraper over and over again to fetch the same product is computationally expensive. Introducing a caching system can improve the user experience.
  - **Comparison with Similar Products**: Give users the oppurtunity to compare similar products by comprehensively displaying their features next to each other.
  - **UI Improvements**: Enhancing the user interface by adopting a consistent design language across the website for a cohesive look and feel.
  - **Login Implementation**: Give users the oppurutunity to login without Google services.
- **Chatbot**: Enhance the application by integrating an AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI's GPT models or other AI services. This chatbot will interact with users to understand their product preferences based on feature descriptions and suggest relevant products sorted by relevancy.
- **Price Tracking and Alerts**: Implementing a feature to track product prices over time and notify users of price changes.
- **Wishlist Enhancements**
  - **Multi-Wishlist**: The wishlist functionality can be further enhanced to incorporate different wishlists so that the user can have different wishlists catering to different products.
  - **Wishlist-Based Recommendations**: Introducing personalized product recommendations based on items added to the user's wishlist.
  - **Improved Wishlist Sharing**: Improving Sharing of Wishlists.
- **Coupon Scraping**: Incorporate coupon scraping functionality to help users save even more by automatically finding and applying available discounts.



:thought_balloon: Use Case
---
* ***Students***: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time to search for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites.Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.
* ***Data Analysts***: Finding data for any project is one of the most tedious job for a data analyst, and the datasets found might not be the most recent one. Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually important.
